This is where you can start a new project, open an existing project or access some tutorials and examples. For now, click on "New Project" to create a blank project.
  
## Create a Simple LED Blink Circuit and Export it as Code
  
Now that you have created a new project, you will see the main interface of Release Code Circuit Wizard. It consists of three main areas:

- The toolbar at the top, where you can access various tools and settings
- The workspace in the middle, where you can design your circuit using components and wires
- The code editor at the bottom, where you can view and edit the code generated by your circuit

To create a simple LED blink circuit, follow these steps:

1. From the toolbar, click on the "Components" button. This will open a panel with various categories of components that you can use in your circuit.
2. From the "Basic" category, drag and drop an "Arduino Uno" component onto the workspace. This will represent the microcontroller that will control your circuit.
3. From the same category, drag and drop an "LED" component onto the workspace. This will represent the light-emitting diode that will blink in your circuit.
4. From the "Power" category, drag and drop a "Battery" component onto the workspace. This will provide power to your circuit.
5. To connect the components with wires, click on the "Wire" tool from the toolbar. Then click on one terminal of a component and drag it to another terminal of another component. A wire will be created between them.
6. Connect the positive terminal of the battery (+) to the 5V pin of the Arduino Uno.
7. Connect the negative terminal of the battery (-) to the GND pin of the Arduino Uno.
8. Connect one leg of the LED to pin 13 of the Arduino Uno.
9. Connect the other leg of the LED to another GND pin of the Arduino Uno.

Your circuit should look something like this:
