Human performance and limitations (HPL) is a subject that covers the basic concepts of human factors in aviation. It aims to provide an understanding of human capabilities and limitations, both physical and psychological, that could affect flight safety and performance. HPL is one of the subjects required for the Airline Transport Pilot Licence (ATPL) examination by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
 
In this article, we will introduce some of the topics covered in Part 1 of the Oxford ATPL HPL course, which focuses on aviation physiology. Aviation physiology is the study of how the human body adapts to the aviation environment, which can be very different from the normal conditions on the ground. Some of the topics include:

- The hypobaric environment: how low atmospheric pressure affects oxygen availability, cabin pressurisation, rapid decompression, decompression sickness and barotrauma.
- The high altitude environment: how exposure to high altitude affects ozone, cosmic radiation, relative humidity and temperature.
- Effects of acceleration: how acceleration forces affect blood circulation, vision and balance.
- Vision: how the eye functions, visual illusions, night vision and visual aids.
- Hearing: how the ear functions, hearing loss, noise and communication.
- Balance: how the vestibular system functions, spatial disorientation and motion sickness.

By learning about these topics, pilots can gain a better awareness of their own physiological responses and limitations in the aviation environment. They can also learn how to prevent or cope with potential problems that may arise due to physiological factors. This can help them to enhance their flight safety and performance.

In Part 2 of the Oxford ATPL HPL course, we will explore some of the topics covered in human psychology and human factors. Human psychology is the study of how the human mind works, how it influences behaviour and how it interacts with other people. Human factors is the application of human psychology to the design and operation of systems and equipment in aviation. Some of the topics include:

- Basic concepts: how human performance is affected by factors such as motivation, stress, fatigue, sleep, information processing, human error and learning.
- Behaviour and motivation: how personality, attitudes, emotions and values influence behaviour and motivation in aviation.
- Cognition in aviation: how mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, reasoning and decision-making are involved in aviation tasks.
- Individual differences and interpersonal relationships: how individual characteristics such as intelligence, aptitude, skills and experience affect performance and how interpersonal relationships such as communication, co-operation and leadership affect teamwork.
- Man and machine: how human-machine interface design, automation and ergonomics affect human performance and safety.
- Decision-making and risk: how pilots make decisions under uncertainty and time pressure and how they assess and manage risks.
- Human factors incident reporting: how to report and analyse incidents involving human factors issues.
- Crew resource management: how to use non-technical skills such as situational awareness, communication, teamwork, leadership, problem-solving and decision-making to enhance flight safety and performance.

By learning about these topics, pilots can gain a better insight into their own psychological processes and factors that may affect their performance and safety. They can also learn how to apply human factors principles and techniques to improve their interaction with other crew members, systems and equipment in aviation. This can help them to achieve a high level of professionalism and competence.
