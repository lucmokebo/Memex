Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 v12.0.1 is a professional video editing software that allows you to create stunning videos with high-quality effects and transitions. You can download and install this software on your computer without an internet connection by using the offline installer setup file. However, you need to make sure that your computer has a 64-bit operating system, as this software will not work on a 32-bit system. Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 also offers a fast and smooth workflow for video production, thanks to the native 64-bit support and the GPU-accelerated Adobe Mercury Playback Engine. This engine leverages the power of your graphics card to render and play back your videos in real time, without any lag or delay.
