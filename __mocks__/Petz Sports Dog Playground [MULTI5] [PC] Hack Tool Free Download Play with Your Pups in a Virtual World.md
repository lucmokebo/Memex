If you are wondering what kind of dog breeds you can choose from in Petz Sports Dog Playground, here is a list of them: Bernese Mountain Dog, Chihuahua, Golden Retriever, Rottweiler, Poodle, Pug, Beagle, Border Collie, Boxer, Dalmatian, German Shepherd, Jack Russell Terrier, Labrador Retriever, Maltese, Shetland Sheepdog, Siberian Husky, West Highland White Terrier, and Yorkshire Terrier. Each breed has its own characteristics and personality, so you can find the one that suits you best.
 
As for the tricks you can teach your dogs, they range from simple commands like sit and stay to more advanced ones like roll over and play dead. You can use the mouse or the keyboard to interact with your dogs and reward them with treats and praise. The more you train your dogs, the more they will learn and obey you. You can also use the tricks to impress your friends and earn extra points in the races.
 
The agility courses are the main attraction of Petz Sports Dog Playground. They are divided into four categories: speed, jump, slalom, and obstacle. Each category has nine courses of increasing difficulty and complexity. You can use the arrow keys or the WASD keys to control your dogs and make them run through the courses as fast as possible. You can also use the space bar or the left mouse button to make them jump over hurdles and other obstacles. You have to avoid hitting any obstacles or going out of bounds, as that will slow you down and lower your score.
 
The multiplayer mode of Petz Sports Dog Playground is where you can challenge your friends and see who has the best dog. You can play with up to four players on the same PC or online via Ubisoft Connect. You can choose from three modes: race, trick contest, and free play. In race mode, you compete in one of the agility courses and try to finish first. In trick contest mode, you perform as many tricks as you can in a limited time and try to get the highest score. In free play mode, you can explore the game's environments and interact with your dogs and other players' dogs.
