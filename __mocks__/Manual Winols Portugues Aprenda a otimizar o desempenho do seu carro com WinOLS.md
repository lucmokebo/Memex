Once you have everything ready, you can launch WinOLS and create a new project. You can either open an existing ECU file or read the data directly from your car's ECU using the interface device. WinOLS will automatically detect the type of ECU and the checksum algorithm. You can then enter some information about your project, such as the car model, engine type, power, etc.
 
After creating a project, you can start searching and editing maps. Maps are the tables that contain the data that control different aspects of your engine. For example, there are maps for fuel injection, ignition timing, boost pressure, torque limiters, etc. WinOLS has several features that help you find and edit maps, such as:

- Automatic map search: WinOLS can scan your ECU file and identify potential maps based on predefined criteria.
- Manual map search: You can also search for maps manually using different modes and tools, such as text mode, 2D mode, 3D mode, preview mode, etc.
- Damos and map packs: These are files that contain information about the maps and their locations in the ECU file. You can import damos and map packs from other sources or create your own using WinOLS.
- Scripts: These are small programs that perform specific tasks on your ECU file or maps. You can use scripts to automate some processes or apply complex calculations.

When editing maps, you need to be careful and follow some best practices. You should always make small changes and test them on your car before making further adjustments. You should also compare your modified version with the original one and check for any errors or inconsistencies. WinOLS can help you with these tasks by providing features such as:

- Checksum correction: WinOLS can automatically correct the checksums of your ECU file after making any changes. Checksums are codes that verify the integrity of the data and prevent corruption.
- Version management: WinOLS allows you to create and manage multiple versions of your project. You can compare different versions and see the differences in maps or hexdump.
- Data analysis: WinOLS provides various tools to analyze the data in your ECU file or maps. You can use graphs, histograms, statistics, formulas, etc.
- Data import and export: WinOLS allows you to import and export data from different sources and formats. You can import data from older projects, files, damos, scripts, etc. You can also export data as files, CSV map lists, map packs, etc.

WinOLS is a powerful software that can help you tune your car with ease and efficiency. However, it is not a magic tool that can do everything for you. You still need to have a good understanding of how your car works and how to use WinOLS properly. That's why Manual Winols Portugues is a valuable resource that can teach you the basics of WinOLS and guide you through the process of tuning your car.
