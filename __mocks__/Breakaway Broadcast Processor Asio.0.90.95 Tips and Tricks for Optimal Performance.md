## What features does Breakaway Broadcast Processor Asio.0.90.95 offer?
 
Breakaway Broadcast Processor Asio.0.90.95 has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to adjust various parameters of your audio signal with only six main controls[^1^]. These are:
 
- **Final Drive:** This controls the distortion and the bass punch at high volumes[^1^].

- **Power:** This modifies the ratio of the AGC and the multiband compressors[^1^].
- **Bass:** This boosts the bass level significantly[^1^].
- **Bass Shape:** This controls the frequency range of the bass[^1^].
- **Treble:** This enhances the clarity and brightness of the high frequencies[^2^].

By using these controls, you can fine-tune your audio signal to obtain the desired volume, bitrate, and effect of the sound in a live transmission[^2^]. You can also adjust for possible deviation, check for compatibility with streaming hardware, and monitor your audio levels in real-time[^2^].
