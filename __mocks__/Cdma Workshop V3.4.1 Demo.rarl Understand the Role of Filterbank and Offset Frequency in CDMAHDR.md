The workshop was part of an ongoing investigation into the market power and practices of "big tech" companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Attorney General William Barr argued that Section 230 was a necessary legal shield to foster the growth and innovation of the Internet when most online companies were still struggling to survive, but he questioned whether it was still appropriate to give such broad protections to "titans of U.S. industry" that dominate the online landscape.[85] Barr clarified that the workshop was not intended to make any policy decisions on Section 230, but rather to explore various issues related to Big Tech from different perspectives, since "not all of the concerns raised about online platforms squarely fall within antitrust" and that the Department of Justice would prefer to see voluntary reform and better incentives by tech companies to moderate online content within the existing framework of Section 230 rather than change the law directly.[85] However, observers who attended the workshop noted that the sessions only focused on Big Tech and small sites that engaged in harmful activities such as revenge porn, harassment, and child sexual abuse, but did not consider much of the intermediate uses of the Internet that benefit from Section 230.[86]
