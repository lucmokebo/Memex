  - \*\*Fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion (FETO)\*\*: This is a procedure that involves placing a balloon in the fetus's airway to block it temporarily. This helps the lungs grow bigger and stronger in fetuses with \*\*congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)\*\*, a birth defect that causes a hole in the diaphragm and prevents normal lung development . - \*\*Fetal cystoscopy\*\*: This is a procedure that involves inserting a flexible camera into the fetus's bladder to diagnose and treat \*\*lower urinary outflow tract obstruction (LUTO)\*\*, a condition that prevents the fetus from passing urine normally. This can cause problems with the kidneys and the amount of amniotic fluid. Fetal cystoscopy can identify the cause of the obstruction and remove it using different techniques such as hydro-ablation, guide-wire probing, electrocoagulation or laser   . - \*\*In utero repair of fetal spina bifida\*\*: This is a procedure that involves closing the opening in the spine of the fetus that causes \*\*spina bifida\*\*, a birth defect that affects the spinal cord and nerves. This can prevent further damage to the nervous system and improve the outcomes for the baby after birth. - \*\*Fetoscopic laser ablation for twin-twin transfusion syndrome\*\*: This is a procedure that involves using a laser to seal off some of the abnormal blood vessels that connect the placentas of identical twins who share one placenta. This can correct the imbalance of blood flow between the twins that causes \*\*twin-twin transfusion syndrome\*\*, a serious complication that can endanger both babies. - \*\*In utero ultrasound-guided treatment for fetal tumors\*\*: This is a procedure that involves using ultrasound to locate and treat tumors that grow in or on the fetus, such as \*\*sacrococcygeal teratoma\*\*, a rare tumor that develops at the base of the spine. Depending on the size and location of the tumor, different methods can be used to shrink or remove it, such as injecting medication, cutting off blood supply, or surgery. - \*\*In utero fetal cardiac interventions\*\*: These are procedures that involve accessing and treating the heart of the fetus using catheters or needles. These can help improve the function and structure of the heart in fetuses with \*\*congenital heart defects\*\*, such as narrowing of valves or vessels, or abnormal openings between chambers. - \*\*In utero treatment of congenital anomalies\*\*: These are procedures that involve correcting or improving various abnormalities that affect the development of different organs or systems in the fetus, such as \*\*gastroschisis\*\*, a defect that causes some of the intestines to protrude outside the abdomen, or \*\*congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM)\*\*, a lung lesion that can compress normal lung tissue.  Dr. Ruano also conducts research on new prenatal imaging technologies, such as ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to better diagnose and monitor fetal conditions. 8cf37b1e13
