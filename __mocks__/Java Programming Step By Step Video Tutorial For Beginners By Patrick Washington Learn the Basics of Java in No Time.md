- Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages in the world. It runs on almost any platform, from desktops to mobile devices to web servers. It is also the language of choice for many enterprise applications and big data systems.
- Java is an object-oriented language, which means that it allows you to create reusable and modular code that can be easily maintained and extended. It also supports multiple inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism, which are key concepts in object-oriented design.
- Java is a high-level language, which means that it abstracts away the details of the hardware and the operating system. It also has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that provide ready-made solutions for common tasks and problems. You can use Java to develop applications for various domains, such as web development, mobile development, game development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
- Java is a compiled language, which means that it converts your source code into bytecode that can be executed by a virtual machine (JVM). This makes Java faster and more efficient than interpreted languages. It also enables Java to be portable and cross-platform, as the same bytecode can run on any machine that has a JVM installed.
