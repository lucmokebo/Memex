ZAR has a simple and intuitive interface that guides you through the recovery process step by step. You can choose from three main modes: Image Recovery, Data Recovery for Windows and Linux, and RAID Recovery. Depending on the mode you select, ZAR will scan your device and display a list of recoverable files. You can preview the files before recovering them and select the ones you want to save.
 
To use ZAR, you need to have a license key that unlocks its full features. However, buying a license key can be expensive and not everyone can afford it. That's why some people look for alternative ways to get a license key for free, such as downloading it from dubious websites or using cracks or keygens. However, these methods are not only illegal but also risky. They can expose your computer to malware infections, damage your system files, or compromise your personal information.
 
Therefore, we strongly advise you to avoid using any illegal or unsafe methods to get a license key for ZAR. Instead, you should purchase a legitimate license key from the official website of ZAR or from authorized resellers. This way, you can enjoy the full benefits of ZAR without any risks or limitations.
 
If you want to try ZAR before buying it, you can download a free trial version from the official website. The trial version allows you to recover up to four folders per scan. However, if you want to recover more files or use advanced features such as RAID recovery or disk image creation, you need to upgrade to the full version with a license key.
 
ZAR is one of the most effective and user-friendly data recovery software in the market. It can help you recover your lost data in various scenarios and from various devices. If you need a reliable and easy-to-use data recovery tool, you should consider using ZAR 9.2 with a valid license key.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use ZAR 9.2 to recover your lost data from a hard disk. We will assume that you have already downloaded and installed ZAR 9.2 on your computer and that you have a valid license key. If you don't have a license key, you can buy one from the official website or use the trial version with limited features.

## Step 1: Launch ZAR 9.2 and select Data Recovery for Windows and Linux
 
After installing ZAR 9.2, launch it from your desktop or start menu. You will see the main window of ZAR 9.2 with three options: Image Recovery, Data Recovery for Windows and Linux, and RAID Recovery. For this tutorial, we will choose Data Recovery for Windows and Linux.
 
Data Recovery for Windows and Linux is the mode that allows you to recover data from hard disks, memory cards, USB flash drives, and other storage devices with FAT, NTFS, EXT, or XFS file systems. This mode can also recover data from damaged or corrupted partitions or disks.
 
## Step 2: Select the disk to scan
 
After selecting Data Recovery for Windows and Linux, you will see a list of physical disks and logical drives detected by ZAR 9.2 on your computer. You need to select the disk that contains the data you want to recover. For example, if you want to recover data from your C: drive, you need to select the physical disk that contains the C: partition.
 
If you are not sure which disk to select, you can use the Disk Properties button to view more information about each disk, such as its size, model, serial number, and partitions. You can also use the Disk Management tool in Windows to identify your disks and partitions.
 
After selecting the disk to scan, click Next to proceed.
 
## Step 3: Select the file system type
 
After selecting the disk to scan, you will see a list of file system types supported by ZAR 9.2. You need to select the file system type that matches the partition or disk you want to recover data from. For example, if you want to recover data from your C: drive that has an NTFS file system, you need to select NTFS.
 
If you are not sure which file system type to select, you can use the Auto Detect option and let ZAR 9.2 determine the file system type automatically. However, this option may take longer and may not be accurate in some cases.
 
After selecting the file system type, click Next to proceed.
 
## Step 4: Scan the disk for recoverable files
 
After selecting the file system type, ZAR 9.2 will start scanning the disk for recoverable files. This process may take some time depending on the size and condition of the disk. You can monitor the progress of the scan on the status bar at the bottom of the window.
 
During the scan, ZAR 9.2 will display a list of folders and files that it has found on the disk. You can expand or collapse each folder to view its contents. You can also use the Filter button to filter the files by name, size, date, or extension.
 
If you want to stop the scan before it is completed, you can click Stop at any time. However, this may result in some files being missed or incomplete.
 
## Step 5: Preview and select the files to recover
 
After the scan is completed or stopped, you can preview and select the files that you want to recover. To preview a file, simply double-click on it or right-click on it and choose Preview. A new window will open showing a preview of the file content.
 
To select a file for recovery, simply check its box on the left side of the window. You can also check an entire folder by checking its box on the left side of the tree view. You can also use the Select All button to select all files or folders in one click.
 
You can also use the Mark Good button to mark all files that have a good chance of being recovered successfully or Mark Bad button to mark all files that have a low chance of being recovered successfully. These buttons are based on ZAR 9.2's estimation of file quality based on various factors such as file size, fragmentation level, and damage level.
