Are you interested in learning how to use statistical methods to answer causal questions in economics and social sciences? Do you want to master the tools of econometric research and apply them to real-world problems? If so, you might want to check out *Mastering 'Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect* by Joshua Angrist and JÃ¶rn-Steffen Pischke.

Angrist and Pischke are both professors of economics at MIT and LSE, respectively, and winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2021. They have written a popular and accessible book that introduces the essential tools of applied econometrics, or what they call 'metrics. The book covers the five most valuable econometric methods, or what they call the Furious Five: random assignment, regression, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity designs, and differences in differences. These methods help economists and other researchers to untangle cause and effect in human affairs, such as the effects of health insurance, education, banking crises, domestic abuse, and more.
 
The book is full of real-world examples, humorous anecdotes, and kung fu-themed illustrations that make econometrics fun and engaging. The book also explains the intuition and logic behind each method, as well as the technical details and assumptions. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as practitioners and policy makers who want to learn how to use data and statistics to illuminate the path from cause to effect.

One of the main challenges of econometrics is to establish causality, or the direction and magnitude of the effect of one variable on another. For example, does having more education cause higher income, or does having higher income cause more education? Or are there other factors that affect both education and income, such as ability, motivation, or family background? To answer these questions, econometricians need to find a source of variation in the explanatory variable that is independent of other factors that might affect the outcome variable. This is called an exogenous or natural experiment.
 
One of the most reliable ways to create an exogenous experiment is to randomly assign the explanatory variable to different groups of individuals. For example, if we want to measure the effect of a new drug on health outcomes, we can randomly assign some patients to receive the drug and some to receive a placebo, and then compare their health outcomes. This method is called random assignment or randomized controlled trial (RCT). RCTs are widely used in medicine, psychology, and social policy, but they are often costly, unethical, or impractical to implement in other settings.

When RCTs are not feasible, econometricians can use other methods that exploit natural or quasi-experiments that occur in the real world. For example, if we want to measure the effect of class size on student achievement, we can use instrumental variables (IV) that affect class size but not student achievement directly, such as the distance from home to school or the birth month of students. IVs help us isolate the variation in class size that is unrelated to other factors that might affect student achievement, such as student ability or teacher quality. IVs are often used in labor economics, public economics, and development economics.
