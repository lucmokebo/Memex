# A Brief Overview of Private Law by Pietro Perlingieri
 
Private law is the branch of law that regulates the relationships between private parties, such as individuals, associations, and companies. It covers topics such as contracts, property, succession, family, and obligations. Private law is based on the principles and norms established by the Constitution of the Italian Republic, as well as by the Civil Code and other sources of law.

One of the most influential and comprehensive textbooks on private law is the *Manuale di Diritto Civile* (Handbook of Civil Law) by Pietro Perlingieri, a professor of civil law at the University of Naples. The book offers a systematic and critical analysis of the main concepts and institutions of private law, with a focus on their historical evolution, social function, and constitutional relevance.
 
The book is divided into six parts: the first part introduces the general notions and principles of private law; the second part deals with persons and family; the third part examines succession; the fourth part explores property; the fifth part discusses obligations; and the sixth part addresses the protection of rights.
 
A summary of Perlingieri's book can be found online in PDF format on various websites, such as Docsity[^1^] and Studocu[^2^] [^3^]. The summary provides a concise and clear overview of the main topics and arguments of each chapter, as well as some examples and references to relevant cases and legislation. The summary can be useful for students who want to review or deepen their knowledge of private law, as well as for anyone who is interested in learning more about this fascinating and complex field of law.
  
One of the main principles of private law is the autonomy of will, which means that each party is free to pursue its own interests and to enter into agreements with others according to its own preferences and goals. The autonomy of will is limited by the respect for the rights and interests of others, as well as by the public order and morality. Another principle of private law is the principle of equality, which means that all individuals are equal before the law and have the same rights and obligations in their private relationships.
 
Private law is not uniform across countries or regions, as it reflects the different legal traditions, cultures, and values of each society. However, there are also some common elements and sources of private law that can be found in many legal systems. For example, many countries have adopted civil codes or statutes that codify the main rules and principles of private law, such as the French Civil Code, the German Civil Code, or the Italian Civil Code. Moreover, many countries are influenced by international conventions or treaties that harmonize or unify some aspects of private law, such as the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), or the European Union regulations on consumer protection or succession.
 
When a private law dispute arises between parties from different countries or jurisdictions, a special branch of private law called conflict of laws (or private international law) comes into play. Conflict of laws deals with the questions of which court has jurisdiction over the case, which law applies to the merits of the dispute, and how foreign judgments or awards can be recognized and enforced. Conflict of laws aims to provide legal certainty and justice for parties involved in cross-border situations, as well as to promote cooperation and coordination among different legal systems.
